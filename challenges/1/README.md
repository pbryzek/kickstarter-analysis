### Dataset Used
Kickstarter Global Dataset 
[KickstarterDataSet](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/140/files/34981/download?wrap=1)

### Excel Spreadsheet Generated
[Challenge 1](data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx)

### Chart Types Used
* Line Graph

### Trends Analyzed and Charts Generated
1. Outcomes of the Kickstarter campaign based on the Goal amount of the kickstarter campaign
![OutcomesBasedOnLaunchDate](charts/OutcomesBasedOnGoal.png)
   * Outcomes included: Successful, Failed, and Canceled; Live campaigns were excluded
   * Countries included: All countries
   * Goal amounts mostly segmented into ranges of 5,000
   * Sub category of the Campaign filtered to "plays"
2.  Outcomes of the Kickstarter campaigns based on the month of the launch date of the campaign
![CategoryOutcomes](charts/OutcomesAndLaunchDate.png)
* Outcomes included: Successful, Failed, Live, and Canceled
* Countries included: All countries
* Category of the Campaign filtered to "theatre"

### Data Driven Recommendations
1. Country & Campaign Specific
  * To increase the probability of a successful campaign, a US based theatre campaign would be advised to keep the Goal amount under the Median Pledged amount of $3,167.
  * For Sub Category Plays in Great Britain the median pledged was $1,887 and as such successful campaigns should look to stay under this threshold.
2. Across all countries and categories, it is advisable to begin the campaign between **March-July**. The months of August-February have resulted in far fewer successful campaigns and significantly more failed campaigns. The best success to failed campaign ratio appears in **April** while the highest number of successful campaigns occurs in **May**.
